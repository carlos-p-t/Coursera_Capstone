# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Coursera Capstone

Welcome to my IBM Data Science Capstone Project repository!

This respository contains the Jupyter Notebooks of the final Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate from Coursera.

The final project makes use of the different tools covered during these courses: Data Analysis with Python, Use of Databases with SQL, Data Visualization, Libraries such as Pandas and SciKit Learn, and Machine Learning techniques. 

## Project and notebooks description

**Project Objective:** To analyze the best location to open an international restaurant in Bratislava by using Data Analysis and Machine Learning techniques.

More details about the project can be found in [this file](https://github.com/carlos-p-t/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/Opening%20a%20Restaurant%20in%20Bratislava_Carlos%20Pizarroso.pdf). A presentation of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/carlos-p-t/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/Opening%20an%20international%20restaurant%20in%20Bratislava_Carlos.pptx).

## Preparation and assignment

As a preparation for the project, an assignment was given which was divided in 3 parts:

[**- Part 1:**](https://github.com/carlos-p-t/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/W3_Assignment_Part1.ipynb) A practice of segmenting and clustering neighborhoods from data obtained from internet. The exercise consisted on retrieving data by scrapping a website, and visualize its contents.

[**- Part 2:**](https://github.com/carlos-p-t/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/W3_Assignment_Part2.ipynb) Continuing with the exercise, this part focused on adding geodata (latitude, longitude) to the data early obtained.

[**- Part 3:**](https://github.com/carlos-p-t/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/W3_Assignment_Part3.ipynb) Last part of the exercise consisted on analyzing the neighborhoods obtained from the previous data, as well as display the different venues these neighborhoods had. A further analysis of neighborhood clusters is also done.

## Capstone Project

The Capstone Project is also divided in two main parts:

[**- Part 1:**](https://github.com/carlos-p-t/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/Capstone%20Project%20(Part%201).ipynb) This first part introduces the business problem as well as the origin of data used for analysis.

[**- Part 2:**](https://github.com/carlos-p-t/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/Capstone%20Project%20(Part%202).ipynb) The second part encompasses all parts of my capstone project.
