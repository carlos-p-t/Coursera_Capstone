    "Deciding to open a restaurant which sells different style of food compared to the local one seems like a good idea. This is because, sometimes, people want to eat something different than what they usually eat. However, before anything, it is important to make some studies and understand the surroundings so the investors/owners can get to know <b> where </b> it is convenient to open the restaurant. Hence, in this project, I will use the Foursquare location data to solve this particular problem and let the investors/owners know which part of Bratislava is a potential candidate to place the new business."
